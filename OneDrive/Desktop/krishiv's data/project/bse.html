            <h2>About BSE</h2>
            <p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is one of the oldest stock exchanges in India. Learn about its history, importance in the financial market, and key indices.</p>
            <p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is the first and largest securities market in India and was established in 1875 as the Native Share and Stock Brokers' Association. Based in Mumbai, India, the BSE lists close to 6,000 companies and is one of the largest exchanges in the world, along with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange Group, Japan Exchange Group, and Shanghai Stock Exchange.

              The BSE has helped develop India's capital markets, including the retail debt market, and has helped grow the Indian corporate sector. The BSE is Asia's first stock exchange and also includes an equities trading platform for small-and-medium enterprises (SME). BSE has diversified into providing other capital market services including clearing, settlement, and risk management.</p>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How BSE Works</h2>
            <p>In 1995, the BSE switched from an open-floor to an electronic trading system. There are more than a dozen electronic exchanges in the U.S. alone with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq being the most widely known.
                <br>
                Today, electronic trading systems dominate the financial industry overall, offering fewer errors, faster execution, and better efficiency than traditional open-outcry trading systems. Securities that the BSE lists include stocks, stock futures, stock options, index futures, index options, and weekly options.
                <br>
                The BSE's overall performance is measured by the Sensex, a benchmark index of 30 of the BSE's largest and most actively traded stocks covering 12 sectors. Debuting in 1986, the Sensex is India's oldest stock index. Also called the "BSE 30," the index broadly represents the composition of India's entire market.
